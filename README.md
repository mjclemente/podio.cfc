# podio.cfc
A CFML wrapper for the Podio API

This is a very early stage API wrapper, and development will likely be limited to the functionality I need for other projects. That said, I'm happy to expand it if others find it helpful. Feel free to use the issue tracker to report bugs or suggest improvements!

This project borrows heavily from the API frameworks built by [jcberquist](https://github.com/jcberquist), such as [stripecfc](https://github.com/jcberquist/stripecfc), [xero-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/xero-cfml), and [aws-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/aws-cfml).
